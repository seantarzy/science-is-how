        In an abstract sense, a set is considered self-containing if it includes itself as one of its elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example to imagine this concept, though not strictly possible in conventional set theory, is a set <code>{`{a, b, c, S}`}</code> where <code>S</code> represents the set itself. Here, <code>S</code> is said to be self-containing by including itself as an element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, a set like <code>{`{1, 2, 3}`}</code> is not self-containing because it only includes numbers as elements and does not include the set itself.
