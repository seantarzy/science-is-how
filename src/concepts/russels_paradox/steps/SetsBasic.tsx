      <p>
        A set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in
        its own right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sets are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics. They are
        used to define many other mathematical objects, such as numbers and
        functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objects in a set are called elements or members of the set. We write
        <code>{`{1, 2, 3}`}</code> to denote a set with elements 1, 2, and 3.
