        <p>
          Russell's Paradox is a famous problem in set theory and logic. It arises when we consider the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. Let's call this set <code>R</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paradoxical question is: Does <code>R</code> contain itself?
        </p>
        <p>
          If <code>R</code> contains itself, then by its own definition, it should not contain itself, since it is the set of all sets that do not contain themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, if <code>R</code> does not contain itself, then according to its definition, it should contain itself, as it is a set that does not contain itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This contradiction shows the difficulties in naive set theory and has led to significant developments in how sets and mathematical logic are understood.
