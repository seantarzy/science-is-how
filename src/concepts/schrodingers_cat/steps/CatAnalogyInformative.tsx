      <p>
        In this thought experiment, a cat is placed in a sealed box with a
        radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of poison. If
        the Geiger counter detects radiation, the hammer will break the vial of
        poison, killing the cat. If the Geiger counter does not detect
        radiation, the cat will remain alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to quantum mechanics, the radioactive atom is in a
        superposition of decayed and undecayed states until it is observed. This
        means that the cat is also in a superposition of alive and dead states
        until the box is opened and the cat is observed.
