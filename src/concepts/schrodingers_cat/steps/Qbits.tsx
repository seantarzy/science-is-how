        Schrodinger's cat wasn't just a fun thought experiment. It was a way to
        explain the concept of superposition, which is a fundamental principle
        of quantum mechanics. This principle is also what makes
        <span className="font-bold"> quantum computing </span> possible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A qubit has some similarities to a classical bit, but is overall very
        different. Like a bit, a qubit can have two possible valuesâ€”normally a 0
        or a 1. The difference is that whereas a bit must be either 0 or 1, a
        qubit can be 0, 1, or a superposition of both.

        This property of superposition is what gives quantum computers their
        inherent advantage over classical computers. A classical computer has to
        perform calculations one after the other, but a quantum computer can
        perform many calculations at the same time.
