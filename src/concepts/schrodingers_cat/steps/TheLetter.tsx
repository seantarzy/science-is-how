        After the EPR paper. Schrödinger, then at Oxford, wrote to Einstein
        expressing his interest and appreciation for the paper, which challenged
        the completeness of quantum mechanics.

        Throughout their letters, Einstein and Schrödinger discussed the
        implications of the EPR paradox and the idea of superposition. Einstein
        used analogies, such as a ball in a box, to illustrate his views on
        quantum mechanics, emphasizing his belief in a complete description of
        physical reality.

        Einstein then posited a thought experiment involving a box of gunpowder.
        If the gunpowder can spontaneously combust, then by quantum mechanic
        principles, the gunpowder is both exploded and unexploded until
        observed. However, "In reality here is just no intermediary between
        exploded and not-exploded...My solution of the paradox presented in our
        work is this. The ψ function does not describe a state of one system,
        rather (statistically) an ensemble of systems."

        This lead Schrodinger to illustrate further. Describing a superposition
        sitation involving a cat an some poison.
