        In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger wrote a letter to Albert Einstein in which he
        discussed the implications of quantum mechanics. In the letter,
        Schrödinger described a thought experiment that would later become known
        as Schrödinger's Cat. The experiment was designed to illustrate the
        paradoxical nature of quantum mechanics and the concept of
        superposition.

        In the experiment, a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive
        atom, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of poison. If the Geiger
        counter detects radiation, the hammer will break the vial of poison,
        killing the cat. If the Geiger counter does not detect radiation, the
        cat will remain alive. According to quantum mechanics, the cat is in a
        superposition of being both alive and dead until the box is opened and
        the cat is observed.
